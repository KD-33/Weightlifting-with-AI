# Middle School Athlete  
Here is his information and goals...  
13 year old male  
Little experience in the weight room (maybe 2 months)  
Wants to get stronger for his sports. He runs cross country, plays basketball, wrestles, and runs and jumps during track season  
He can commit to working out 2 days a week on top of his practice schedule  
He has access to a gym, but should be kept away from dumbbells and focus on machines. He's not super coordinated yet so we don't want him to injure himself using free weights.  
He has Osgood-Schlatter disease so his knees usually cause him a lot of pain

### Important notes:  
Start with light weights and focus on proper form. Gradually increase weight as he becomes more comfortable with the exercises.  
For exercises involving the legs, especially the Leg Press, use very light weights due to his Osgood-Schlatter disease. If any exercise causes knee pain, reduce the weight or skip it entirely.  
Proper warm-up and cool-down are crucial. Include some light stretching after each session.  
Encourage him to listen to his body. If something hurts (beyond normal muscle fatigue), he should stop the exercise.  
Ensure he stays well-hydrated and maintains a balanced diet to support his training and multiple sports activities.  
As he grows and his coordination improves, you may gradually introduce some bodyweight exercises or resistance band work for functional strength.  
Regularly check in with his sports coaches and consider consulting a physical therapist about managing his Osgood-Schlatter disease alongside his training.
