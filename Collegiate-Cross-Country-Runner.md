### Guidelines for this cycle:  
Focus on proper form and controlled movements.  
Choose weights that allow you to complete the prescribed reps with the last 1-2 reps being challenging.  
Rest 60-90 seconds between sets for compound movements, 30-60 seconds for isolation exercises.  
If you can easily complete the upper range of reps for all sets, increase the weight slightly in the next session.  
Perform a proper warm-up before each session, including dynamic stretching and activation exercises.  
Cool down with static stretching after each session.
